                    Talk on Special Relativity
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    The Physics Talk series held on Tuesday, 24th January 2018, at the Physics Lab, had a speaker, Ms. Shreya Birje, SE Mech A, who gave an insightful talk on the theory of Special Relativity. The objective of the talk was to provide a basic understanding of the theory of Special Relativity to the audience.

                <div class="para">
                    Ms. Birje began the session by discussing why Classical Mechanics failed to explain certain phenomena like the Michelson-Morley experiment. She then introduced the postulates of Special Relativity, which form the foundation of the theory. The first postulate states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, while the second postulate states that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames of reference.

                <div class="para">
                    Ms. Birje then went on to derive the time-relative time equation, which shows that time is relative and depends on the relative motion between two observers. She explained that time dilation occurs because the speed of light is constant and is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion.

                <div class="para">
                    The Twins Paradox was another interesting topic that was discussed in the session. Ms. Birje explained how the paradox arises when one twin travels at a high speed relative to the other twin, and the traveling twin experiences time dilation, which results in the two twins aging at different rates.

                <div class="para">
                    The session concluded with the question, "Can you travel through time?" Ms. Birje explained that while time travel is theoretically possible according to the laws of Special Relativity, it is not yet technologically feasible.

                    In conclusion, the Math-Physics quiz was a great success, and it was a wonderful opportunity for the students to showcase their knowledge and skills in Mathematics and Physics. The event was well-organized, and the Math and Physics club of DBIT deserves praise for organizing such a wonderful event.

                    Overall, the talk on Special Relativity was informative and engaging, and the audience gained a better understanding of the fundamental concepts of the theory.
