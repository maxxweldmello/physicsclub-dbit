                    A Talk on Quantum Superposition and Uncertainty
                </div>
               

                <div class="para">
                    On 20th February 2018, Mr. Sarang Gawane, an undergraduate student of the Computer Engineering department, delivered a talk on the "Uncertainty Principle and Quantum Superposition" to the members of the Applied Physics Club. The event was well attended by students and faculty members interested in physics and quantum mechanics.

                <div class="para">
                    The speaker presented an intuitive approach to understanding the concepts of quantum superposition and uncertainty principle. Instead of delving into rigorous mathematical derivations, the talk focused on delivering a clear and concise explanation of these mind-bending topics.

                <div class="para">
                    Mr. Gawane began by discussing the basic principles of quantum mechanics and introduced the concept of a quantum state. He then explained how a quantum state can exist in a state of superposition, where it can simultaneously occupy multiple states. He used various examples to explain how this principle applies in the real world.

                <div class="para">
                    The speaker also discussed the uncertainty principle, which states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. He explained how this principle is related to the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics and how it affects our ability to observe and measure particles at the quantum level.

                <div class="para">
                    After the talk, there was a brief Q&A session where attendees had the opportunity to ask questions and clarify their doubts. The student attendees expressed their interest in having a discussion and lecture on the said topic at length and explore the subject in greater detail if possible.
