                    DBIT had organized a competition named Errorwood, as a part of the Colosseum (Technical Festival) events on 27th February 2019. The competition was designed to find the flaws in physics concepts in certain movie scenes. Around 12 teams participated in the competition, and they were given a set of movie scenes to analyze.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The teams were required to identify the errors in the physics concepts presented in the movie scenes and propose ways to correct them. The teams were judged based on their ability to identify the errors accurately and the creativity of their proposed solutions.

                <div class="para">
                    After careful evaluation, three teams emerged as the best among the others. These teams demonstrated exceptional analytical skills and were able to identify errors that were not obvious to the others. Their proposed solutions were also creative and well thought out.
