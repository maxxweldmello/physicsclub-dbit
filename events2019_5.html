                    The Periodic Table event was held on 28th February 2019 at Nehru Planetarium, featuring a talk by Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya. The event was organized to discuss the journey in the making of the periodic table and highlight the contributions of scientists in creating this fundamental element classification system.

                    The talk covered various topics related to the periodic table, including the ambiguity of hydrogen, Seaborg actinides, the story of helium, Lockyers and Harkins Rule, and the work of scientists for the table. Dr. Bhattacharya spoke in detail about the history of the periodic table and the significant contributions of scientists like Mendeleev, Seaborg, and Bohr in its creation.

                    The talk began with an introduction to the history of the periodic table and the role of Dmitri Mendeleev in its creation. Dr. Bhattacharya explained how Mendeleev's periodic law helped in the organization of the elements and paved the way for the development of the modern periodic table. He also discussed the ambiguity of hydrogen, which is placed separately in the periodic table despite having properties that align with both alkali metals and halogens.

                    Dr. Bhattacharya then spoke about the Seaborg actinides, which are the radioactive elements located at the bottom of the periodic table. He discussed the challenges in their discovery and their use in various fields, including nuclear energy.

                    The Lockyers and Harkins Rule, which explains the formation of elements, was also discussed in detail, along with the work of scientists who contributed to the creation of the periodic table.
                    <br><br>
                    In conclusion, the Periodic Table event at Nehru Planetarium was a great success. Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya's informative and engaging talk provided a comprehensive overview of the journey in the making of the periodic table and its significance in modern science. The event was attended by a diverse audience, including students, researchers, and enthusiasts of science
