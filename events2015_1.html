                    The event was marked by demonstrations by the members of the DBIT Physics Club. Balaji Dontha (SE-EXTC) demonstrated the Hall Effect sensor and infrared proximity sensor to the first-year students of DBIT. He explained the working model of the sensors in great detail, and the students were able to understand the practical application of the theories they had learned in the classroom.
