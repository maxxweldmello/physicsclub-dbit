                    Visit to R.D. National College of Arts, Science, and Commerce

                <div class="para">
                    On November 17th, 2017, I visited R.D. National College of Arts, Science, and Commerce along with teachers Jyoti Nimbhorkar and Sameer Hadkar. The primary objective of our visit was to have an open interaction with Dr. Milind Kulkarni, an ex-DBIT faculty, and gain insight into laboratory registers that were prepared by them.

                <div class="para">
                    During the visit, we had a brief discussion with their Physics faculty, where various topics related to the lab were discussed. We also had an opportunity to learn about the research works done in their college and perform some Physics experiments in their lab.

                <div class="para">
                    Furthermore, we had an interaction session with MSc students where they talked about various Physics projects. The students shared their knowledge and experiences, and we were impressed by their depth of understanding and enthusiasm towards Physics.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The visit was insightful and informative, and it provided us with an opportunity to learn from the experiences of the faculty and students at R.D. National College. We were particularly impressed with the way laboratory registers were prepared and maintained, which reflected a high level of discipline and attention to detail.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    In conclusion, the visit to R.D. National College of Arts, Science, and Commerce was a valuable experience, and we hope to have more such opportunities in the future to learn and collaborate with other institutions.
