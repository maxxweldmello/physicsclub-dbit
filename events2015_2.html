                    Visit to Mumbai University Physics Department
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    On February 26th, 2015, four first-year engineering students from Don Bosco Institute of Technology, namely Kalina, Mitchelle Creado, Ria Charly, Yashasvi, and Alisha Braganza, along with their faculty member, Mr. Sameer Hadkar, visited the Physics Department of Mumbai University. The purpose of the visit was to explore the various experiments on display in the exhibition.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The students were first taken to the exhibition area where they witnessed different experiments related to physics. The exhibition showcased a wide range of experiments, including objects with the same or similar refractive index, plastic being attracted to a magnet in water, total internal reflection of light, the use of lasers to detect impurities in water, the functioning of light in a water fountain, photoelasticity, holography, the velocity of light using a microwave oven and papad, and the application of physics in a plasma globe.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The first experiment that caught the students' attention was the demonstration of objects with the same or similar refractive index. The experiment showed how objects made of different materials can appear invisible when submerged in a liquid with a refractive index that matches their own. This concept was new and fascinating to the students.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The second experiment showcased the attraction of plastic to a magnet in water. This experiment demonstrated how the magnetic field passes through water and can attract plastic objects. The students were able to observe the force of attraction of the magnet and how it was affected by the distance between the magnet and the plastic.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The third experiment displayed total internal reflection of light. The demonstration showed how light passing through a denser medium is completely reflected when it strikes the interface between the two media at an angle greater than the critical angle. The students were impressed by the effect of total internal reflection, which made the glass sheet look like a mirror.
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    The use of lasers to detect impurities in water was the fourth experiment showcased. The experiment displayed how a laser beam is used to detect impurities in water, and the students were amazed by the sensitivity and accuracy of this technique.
                </div>
                
                <div class="para">
                    The fifth experiment showcased the functioning of light in a water fountain. The students observed the beautiful and colorful display of light in a fountain, which was created by the interaction between the water and the light.
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    The sixth experiment displayed photoelasticity. The experiment demonstrated how materials can change their refractive index when subjected to stress, and the students were able to observe the effect of stress on the refractive index of the material.
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    The seventh experiment showcased holography. The demonstration displayed how a hologram is created and how it can be used to create a 3D image of an object. The students were impressed by the realistic 3D image created by the hologram.
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    The eighth experiment displayed the velocity of light using a microwave oven and papad. The experiment demonstrated how the velocity of light can be calculated using a simple experiment involving a microwave oven and papad. The students were amazed at how such a simple experiment could be used to calculate the velocity of light.
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    Finally, the ninth experiment showcased the application of physics in a plasma globe. The demonstration showed how a plasma globe works and the students were able to observe the fascinating display of electrical discharges within the globe.
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    In conclusion, the visit to the Physics Department of Mumbai University was an enriching and informative experience for the first-year engineering students from Don Bosco Institute of Technology. They were able to witness a range of experiments related to physics and gain a better understanding of various concepts related to the subject. The exhibition helped the students to connect the theory they learned in the classroom to real-life applications and provided them with a glimpse of the exciting and innovative research happening in the field of physics.
