                        <h3>Introduction: </h3>
                        The newly formed Physics club of our college participated in the event called 'Enlighten'
                        organized by the University of Mumbai on 28th February 2015. The event was aimed at providing
                        knowledge and exposure to the latest advancements in the field of science and technology. A
                        group of 9 members of the physics club led by Prof. Sameer Hadkar and Atul Pednekar participated
                        in the event.

                        <h3>Event Details:</h3>
                        The group reached the MU campus at 2:00 pm and was given a brief about various departments by
                        Mr. Sameer Hadkar. After the introduction, the group headed towards the PGDIT lab to attend
                        various experiments and demonstrations.

                        <h3>Demonstrations:</h3>
                        The following demonstrations were conducted at the event: <br><br>
                        <strong>1. Human Visual System and Optical Illusion:</strong><br>
                        The first demonstration was about the human visual system and the optical illusion created by
                        the human eye. The physics club members were shown various optical illusions, and they were
                        explained the scientific reason behind the illusion. The demonstration was an eye-opener for the
                        members, and they gained valuable insights into the functioning of the human eye.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Solar System:</strong><br>
                        The second demonstration was about the solar system. The members were shown the models of the
                        solar system and were explained the planetary motions, their orbits, and the effects of gravity.
                        The demonstration helped the members to understand the concepts of astronomy and astrophysics.

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>3. Sound:</strong><br>
                        The third demonstration was about sound. The members were shown the various properties of sound
                        waves and how they travel. They were also shown how sound waves can be amplified and modulated.
                        The demonstration was an enriching experience for the members, and they learned about the
                        practical applications of sound waves.

                        <br><br>
                       <strong> 4. Total Internal Reflection:</strong><br>
                        The fourth demonstration was about 'Total Internal Reflection.' The members were shown how light
                        can be reflected within a medium without refracting, which is known as total internal
                        reflection. They were also shown the practical applications of total internal reflection in
                        fiber optics and other technologies.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>5. Laser:</strong> <br>
                        The fifth and final demonstration was about LASER. The members were shown how a laser beam is
                        produced and the properties of laser light. They were also shown the various applications of
                        lasers in industry and technology.

                        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                        The event 'Enlighten' was an excellent opportunity for the members of the Physics club to gain
                        knowledge and exposure to the latest advancements in the field of science and technology. The
                        demonstrations were informative, and the members gained valuable insights into the practical
                        applications of various concepts in physics. The event was a success, and the members look
                        forward to attending similar events in the future.
