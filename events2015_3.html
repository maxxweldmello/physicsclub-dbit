                    Talk on Gravitational Collapse
                </div>

                <div class="para">
                    On 30th March 2015, an event named Gravitational Collapse was organized in Mumbai. The event was held at a venue that hosted students from various colleges. The lecture was given by Shivam Mishra, an internationally acclaimed science communicator.

                <div class="para">
                    The topic of the lecture was the concept of gravity, how celestial bodies are formed, and the reason for their shapes. The focus was on the phenomenon of gravitational collapse, which is the process by which a massive object collapses under the influence of its own gravity.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The lecture began with an introduction to the concept of gravity and its significance in the universe. Shivam Mishra explained how gravity is the force that holds everything together, from the smallest atoms to the largest galaxies.

                <div class="para">
                    He then went on to describe the process of gravitational collapse, which occurs when the gravitational force of a massive object becomes strong enough to overcome the forces that hold it up. This results in the object collapsing in on itself, forming a dense core.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The audience was then introduced to the different types of celestial bodies that are formed through the process of gravitational collapse. These include stars, planets, and black holes. Shivam Mishra explained how the mass and composition of an object determine the type of celestial body it will become.                    
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The lecture also covered the reason for the shapes of celestial bodies. Shivam Mishra explained how the force of gravity pulls matter towards the center of an object, resulting in a spherical shape. He also talked about how other factors such as rotation and the presence of other objects can affect the shape of a celestial body.
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    The event was attended by students from the First Year (2014 Batch) of various colleges in Mumbai. The lecture was highly informative and engaging, and the audience was actively involved in the discussion. 
                </div>
                <div class="para">
                    In conclusion, the Gravitational Collapse event was a great opportunity for students to learn about the concept of gravity and its role in the formation and shape of celestial bodies. Shivam Mishra's lecture was highly informative and engaging, and it provided a great learning experience for all those in attendance.
